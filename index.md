# Rahman Minimalist Training Program – 4 Days/Week

> **Goal:** ~45 min per session (≈3 hrs/week). Low volume, high intensity, focused on progressive overload and great form. Auto-regulated via **RPE**.

---

## Quick-Start
- **Split:** Mon (Upper A), Tue (Lower A), Thu (Upper B), Fri (Lower B)
- **Intensity:** Working sets at **RPE 8–10** (≤2 reps in reserve). Warm-ups don’t count toward listed set totals.
- **Tempo:** Controlled eccentric (2–3s), smooth concentric, full ROM.
- **Rest times:** As listed; if form degrades, rest a little longer.

---

## TL;DR Warm-Up
- **General:** 5–10 min light cardio (HR 100–135 BPM).
- **Dynamic drills:** Arm swings, leg swings (front/back + side/side on leg days), 12 reps each.
- **Exercise-specific warm-ups:** 0–3 ramping sets before heavy lifts.
  - 1 set: ~60% of work weight × same reps as working set.
  - 2 sets: ~50% of work weight × full reps, then ~70% × fewer reps.
  - 3 sets: ~45% of work weight × full reps, ~65% × fewer reps, ~85% × fewer reps.
- **Keep them easy.** Move quickly between warm-up sets. Take ~30–60s before your first heavy working set.
